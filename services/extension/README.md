# Welcome

Welcome to Security Seal, the security vulnerability scanner. We utilize an advanced microservices architecture with an LLM to analyze your code for security vulnerabilities. This version of the software is for testing purposes

## How to use Security Seal

1. Make sure you are either at campus utilizing eduroam, or using eduVPN. Navigate to xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xxx, and create an account. In this web-application you will be able to see the complete report of your most recent vulnerability scan, including the full code and all detected vulnerabilities.

2. Select the code you want to analyze, right-click and select "Analyze code with Security Seal. <img width="360" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Ic4rus90/Bachelor/assets/104506911/056db8d8-2d3f-4824-9827-1515bea71f93">

3. Authenticate with the user you created with the web application. <img width="387" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Ic4rus90/Bachelor/assets/104506911/35f0020f-4abc-4ad8-b952-9b623391ea27">

4. When authentication is successfull, close the tab and go back to Visual Studio Code. Right-click the selected code again, and select "Analyze with Security Seal. You will not have to perform the authentication every time you use the service.

5. Sit back and wait for our system to perform the check. This might take some time, so have patience.  

6. When the process has finished, you will get a summary of the generated report in the extension, containing the vulnerabilities detected. To see the full report, sign in to the web application.

7. If you wish to log out of the web application or delete your account, you can click the account button in the upper right hand corner of the web application, and select the respective option.
